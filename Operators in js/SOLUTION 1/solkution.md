## Ternary Operator
The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement in a single line. 

### Syntax

**Ternary Operator:**

```javascript
condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;
```

Here, `condition` is a Boolean expression that evaluates to either true or false. If the condition is true, the value of `expression_if_true` is returned; otherwise, the value of `expression_if_false` is returned.

**Nested Ternery Operator:**

```js
condition1 ? expression_if_condition1_true : (condition2 ? expression_if_condition2_true : expression_if_condition2_false);
```
