## Comma Operator
In JavaScript, the comma operator , is used to evaluate multiple expressions in a single statement. It evaluates each of its operands from left to right and returns the value of the rightmost operand. The expressions to the left of the comma are evaluated for their side effects.

### Syntax
```bash
expression1, expression2, expression3, ..., expressionN
```

### Example
```bash
let a = 5, b = 10, c = 15;

// The comma operator is used in the initialization of variables
let result = (a++, b++, c++);

console.log(result); // Outputs the value of c, which is 15
console.log(a,b,c);      // (Outputs 6,11,16)
```
